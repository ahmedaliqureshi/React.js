JSX vs React:- 

React.createElement is verbose 

JSX makes code easier to write and understand 

eg:- 

const heading = <h1>hello form react </h1>

bundlers:- you're shipping department 

a bundlers takes all you're source assests and ouputs an optimised bundle
that browsers can download. 

typical pipeline:- 

1) read every import/require.
2) transpile (JSX->JS, TS->JS). 
3) concatenate/code-split. 
4) minify and tree-shake unused code. 
5) generate hashed filenames for long-terms caching. 
6) serve with HMR (hot module replacement) during development.
