why react:- 

1)better reuseability. 
2)large-scale performance in production. 
3)clean separation of concerns via components 
4) essier maintaenenace and testing. 

folder structure:- 

src/ 
componenets/ 
pages/ 
utils/

.jsx vs .js which one for components

1) use .jsx  for files containing JSX

const MyComponent = () => {
    return <h1>hello,JSX</h2>;
};
export default MyComponenet; 

pros for .jsx:- 

clarity, indicated the presence of JSX. 
better editor support.
matches community convention. 

2) you can use .js,when

cons

misleading for JSX-containing files. 
may confuses older tooling. 
less expressive in files lists. 

best practice:- 

use .jsx for componenets. 
use .js for utilites, config, and non-jsx logic. 

3) Importing files in react

import header from "./componenets/Header.jsx"

4) constants&static data:- 

4.1) don't keep large static data or hardcoded strings inside componenets. 

4.2) instaed, extract to utils

export const CDN_LINK="https://cdnlinks.com"; 
export const URL= "https://suhail.app"'


cpmst data= [{
    //complete large data set
}
];

export degault data;


5)export Tips:- 

5.1) Named export:- 

export const CDN_LINKS="https://cdnlinks.com";

import {CDN_LINKS,URL} from  "../utils/constants"; 

5.2)default export:- 

export default data; 

import data from "../utils/mackdata";

Files guidelines:- 

1) avoid fiels longer than 100 lines. 

2) if you exceed that, refactor into smaller components or files . 

3) follow the above steps to keep you're react project clean, scalable, and production-rreaduy.
